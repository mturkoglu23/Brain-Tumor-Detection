Brain Tumor Detection 



Brain tumor, which is the most common form of cancer, is a fatal disease. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of this disease and determining the type of tumor are of great importance in terms of early treatment. In this context, research, and interest in the development of automatic systems for the problems experienced in brain tumor classification, based on deep learning, have increased recently. In this paper, a unique framework is proposed, which is based on Bayesian optimization-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep features ensemble, for the classification of brain tumors. In this method, brain MRI images are first improved. Second, the features are extracted using pre-trained CNN-based deep architectures and then combined. Later, effective, and distinctive features are selected from these deep features using the MrMr algorithm. Finally, the training and testing phases are carried out using the SVM classifier based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm. A dataset named Figshare, containing brain tumors such as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary, is used to test the proposed system. In the experimental studies, the accuracy score of the model proposed was observed to be more successful than that of the other studies.
